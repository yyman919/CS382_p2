Mission Demolition
Extra Feature: Moving Shield
Description
An additional feature has been added to the game: a rectangular shield that moves up and down randomly, creating a dynamic obstacle. The shield is attached to a pole and actively blocks the path of projectiles, requiring players to time their shots carefully.

Purpose
The moving shield adds an element of unpredictability and challenge. Players must not only aim well but also time their shots to avoid or take advantage of the shield's movement.

Gameplay Impact
The shield moves up and down randomly, using Unity's physics and animation system.
Players need to time their shots to avoid the moving shield, adding a layer of difficulty and requiring more skill and strategy.
If a projectile hits the shield, it will be blocked or deflected, forcing the player to re-aim or wait for the right moment.
How to Play
Aim and pull back the slingshot while paying attention to the shieldâ€™s movement.
Time your shots carefully to avoid hitting the shield as it moves up and down.
